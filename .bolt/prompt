We are making a system where the user easily with a few clicks can create awesome full arrangement chord progressions that match with his arrangement - and download these chord progressions as MIDI.

Chords are named with:
1) Root from {C,C#/Db,D,D#/Eb,E,F,F#/Gb,G,G#/Ab,A,A#/Bb,B}.
2) Basic triads: C (major), Cm, Cdim/C°, Caug/C+, Csus2, Csus4, C5.
3) 6/add: C6, Cm6, C(add9), Cm(add9), C6/9.
4) 7ths: C7, Cmaj7, Cm7, Cdim7/C°7, Cm7b5, Cm(maj7).
5) 9ths: C9, Cm9, Cmaj9.
6) 11ths: C11, Cm11, Cmaj11.
7) 13ths: C13, Cm13, Cmaj13.
8) Alterations: C7(b9,#9,b5,#5,b13), etc.
9) Slash chords: C/E, C/G, etc.
We default #/b by key context; user may override.
